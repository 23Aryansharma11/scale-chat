# 🚀 Scalable Chat App – Proof of Concept with Express.js, Kafka, and Redis

This project is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** for a **scalable, real-time chat application** backend architecture. It showcases how to combine **Express.js**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Redis** to build an event-driven system that can handle high-throughput messaging with low latency.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Express.js** – RESTful API backend
- **Kafka** – Message broker for scalable pub/sub communication
- **Redis** – In-memory store for real-time updates and caching
- **KafkaJS** – Kafka client for Node.js
- **Docker Compose** – Service orchestration for local development

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Real-time message publishing via Kafka
- ✅ Redis integration for rapid pub/sub and caching
- ✅ Modular, scalable backend design
- ✅ Easy local development with Docker

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview


- Kafka acts as the **event backbone** for the system.
- Redis enables **fast message delivery** and potential session storage.
- Express handles **authentication, routing**, and API endpoints.
